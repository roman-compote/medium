# Publishing Checklist

Use this checklist for every article before and after publishing.

---

## Phase 1: Review & Refine (2-4 hours)

### Content Review
- [ ] Read draft aloud for flow and awkward phrasing
- [ ] Fact-check all metrics (commit counts, test numbers, timelines)
- [ ] Verify all links work (product URLs, documentation links)
- [ ] Check for sensitive information (API keys, internal URLs, private data)
- [ ] Confirm tone balance: ~65% positive / ~35% honest challenges

### Structure Review
- [ ] Hook grabs attention in first 2-3 paragraphs
- [ ] Each section transitions smoothly to the next
- [ ] Code examples are clear, syntactically correct, and relevant
- [ ] Length is 6-8 minutes (1,500-2,000 words)
- [ ] Conclusion has a compelling CTA

### Quality Review
- [ ] Grammar and spell check (Grammarly or similar)
- [ ] Mobile preview — check readability (50%+ of Medium readers are mobile)
- [ ] Get a second opinion (friend, colleague, fresh eyes)
- [ ] Remove any filler words or vague claims — replace with specifics

---

## Phase 2: Visuals (1-2 hours)

- [ ] 3-5 images included (screenshots, diagrams, stock photos)
- [ ] 1-2 code snippets with syntax highlighting
- [ ] All images have alt text
- [ ] Preview image created at 1200x630px (see `shared/templates/preview-image-guide.md`)
- [ ] No sensitive data visible in screenshots
- [ ] Images are under 5MB each

---

## Phase 3: Medium Formatting (30-60 min)

- [ ] Copy draft into Medium editor
- [ ] Format headers (H2 for main sections, H3 for subsections)
- [ ] Format code blocks with syntax highlighting
- [ ] Add images with captions
- [ ] Add pull quotes (blockquotes for key insights)
- [ ] Insert line breaks for readability
- [ ] Finalize title (under 70 characters)
- [ ] Write subtitle (1-2 sentences)
- [ ] Upload preview image

---

## Phase 4: Metadata & SEO (15-30 min)

- [ ] Choose 5 relevant tags (see `shared/author-bio.md` for common tags)
- [ ] Write meta description (156 characters max)
- [ ] Consider publication submission (Better Programming, The Startup, etc.)
- [ ] Set canonical URL if cross-posting later

---

## Phase 5: Publish

- [ ] Publish on Medium
- [ ] Verify preview image displays correctly
- [ ] Test article link on mobile
- [ ] Check Open Graph preview (paste link into social media composer)

---

## Phase 6: Promote (1-2 hours)

### Day 1 (Publication day) — Critical window
- [ ] LinkedIn post (link in first comment, not in post body)
- [ ] Twitter/X thread with key metrics
- [ ] Respond to ALL comments within first hour

### Day 2-3
- [ ] Reddit posts (r/programming, r/webdev, r/SideProject — pick most relevant)
- [ ] Hacker News submission (use exact article title, no editorializing)
- [ ] Share in relevant Slack/Discord communities

### Week 1
- [ ] Dev.to cross-post with canonical URL pointing to Medium
- [ ] Engage with every comment on all platforms
- [ ] Tag relevant people/companies on LinkedIn/Twitter (if appropriate)

### Ongoing
- [ ] Track engagement metrics (views, read ratio, claps, comments)

- [ ] Create follow-up content from interesting comment questions
