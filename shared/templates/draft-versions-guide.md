# Draft Versions Guide

Each article progresses through focused draft versions. Each version has a specific purpose — don't try to do everything in one pass.

## Version Progression

### Draft v1 — Structure Dump

**Goal:** Get all content out of your head and into the document.

- Follow the outline section by section
- Don't worry about word count, tone, or polish
- Include all data points, even if rough
- Mark gaps with `<!-- TODO: ... -->` placeholders
- Write more than needed — cutting is easier than expanding

**Done when:** Every section has content, even if rough.

### Draft v2 — Structure Edit

**Goal:** Fix the narrative arc and section flow.

- Reorder sections if the flow feels wrong
- Cut or merge sections that overlap
- Ensure transitions between sections are smooth
- Hit the target word count range (1,500-2,000 words)
- Verify the hook grabs attention in the first 2-3 paragraphs
- Check that the conclusion ties back to the hook

**Done when:** Reading front-to-back feels like a natural story.

### Draft v3 — Tone & Voice Pass

**Goal:** Make it sound like you, not a report.

- Apply the 65% positive / 35% challenges balance
- Replace vague claims with specific numbers
- Convert passive voice to first-person active
- Add personality — conversational phrases, honest admissions
- Insert blockquotes for key insights
- Add code snippets and visual placeholders
- Check against [[style-guide]] for tone targets

**Done when:** Reading it aloud sounds natural and engaging.

### Draft v4 — Final Polish

**Goal:** Publication-ready quality.

- Grammar and spell check (Grammarly or similar)
- Verify all metrics against source data (see `insights/data.md`)
- Confirm all links work
- Check for sensitive information (API keys, internal URLs)
- Mobile preview readability
- Ensure 3-5 images are placed
- Finalize title (under 70 characters)
- Write subtitle
- Final read-aloud test

**Done when:** Ready to paste into Medium editor.

## Quick Reference

| Version | Focus           | Key Question                              |
|---------|-----------------|-------------------------------------------|
| v1      | Structure Dump  | Is everything captured?                   |
| v2      | Structure Edit  | Does it flow as a story?                  |
| v3      | Tone & Voice    | Does it sound like me?                    |
| v4      | Final Polish    | Would I be proud to publish this?         |

## Tips

- **Never skip v1.** Writing and editing are different modes — separate them.
- **Sleep on it between v2 and v3.** Fresh eyes catch tone issues.
- **Get a second opinion before v4.** Another person catches what you've gone blind to.
- **Each version should be a new file** (`draft-v1.md`, `draft-v2.md`, etc.) so you can reference earlier versions if you cut too much.
