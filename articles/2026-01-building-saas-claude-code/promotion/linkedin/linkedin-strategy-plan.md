# LinkedIn Promotion Strategy: Ed Donner Course Connection

## Strategy Overview

**Core Concept:** Frame the Medium article as a practical application of Ed Donner's AI Agent Product Development courses - connecting theory (Udemy courses) with practice (Boailoop MVP).

**Why This Works:**

2. **Value exchange**: You're giving credit to Ed Donner while showcasing practical results
3. **Virality potential**: Ed Donner has broad audience and reposts student success stories
4. **Credibility boost**: Connects educational foundation with real-world execution
5. **Community engagement**: LinkedIn loves learning journey stories

## LinkedIn Post Strategy

### Approach A: "From Student to Builder" (Recommended)

**Hook:** Ed Donner's courses taught me AI agent theory. 4 weeks ago, I decided to put it into practice.

   - State the outcome (production SaaS in 4 weeks)

2. **The Journey** (3-4 paragraphs)
   - What you learned from the courses
   - The "aha moment" that made you start building
   - How course concepts translated to real implementation
   - Specific course lessons that proved critical

3. **The Results** (metrics + proof)
   - 468 commits, 695 tests, 25 API endpoints
   - Production deployment on Vercel
   - Real users getting value

4. **The Link** (call to action)
   - Full story on Medium (link)
   - Appreciation to Ed Donner
   - Invitation for others to share their learning journey

5. **Tag Strategy**
   - Tag Ed Donner (primary)
   - Tag relevant AI/SaaS thought leaders (2-3 max)
   - Use hashtags: #AIAgents #BuildInPublic #ProductDevelopment

### Approach B: "Course Review + Case Study"

**Hook:** I just finished Ed Donner's 4th AI Agent course on Udemy. Here's what happened when I applied everything I learned.

**Structure:**

1. Course appreciation (what you learned)
2. Decision to build Boailoop
3. How course concepts showed up in real development
4. Results achieved
5. Would you recommend? (YES + link to article)

### Approach C: "Timeline Story"

**Hook:**

- Summer 2025: Enrolled in Ed Donner's AI Agent courses
- End of 2025: Built production SaaS

- Today: Sharing what I learned

**Structure:**

- Timeline format (visual/engaging)
- Course concepts → Implementation examples
- Metrics and results
- Link to full article

## Tactical Execution Plan

### Step 1: Research & Attribution

- [ ] List all 4 Ed Donner course names (exact titles from Udemy)
- [ ] Identify 2-3 specific concepts from courses that directly impacted Boailoop
- [ ] Find Ed Donner's LinkedIn profile URL
- [ ] Review Ed Donner's recent LinkedIn posts to understand his tone/style

### Step 2: Draft LinkedIn Post

- [ ] Choose approach (A, B, or C)
- [ ] Write hook (first 2-3 sentences - CRITICAL for engagement)
- [ ] Draft body (keep under 1300 characters for optimal engagement)
- [ ] Add call to action with Medium article link
- [ ] Add relevant hashtags (3-5 max)

### Step 3: Visual Content

- [ ] Select 1-2 images from Medium article (UI screenshots work well)
- [ ] Consider creating a "Before/After" graphic:
  - Before: Ed Donner course thumbnails
  - After: Boailoop dashboard screenshot
- [ ] Ensure images are high quality (LinkedIn compresses heavily)

### Step 4: Timing & Engagement

- [ ] Post during high-engagement hours (Tuesday-Thursday, 8-10 AM or 5-7 PM EST)
- [ ] Respond to every comment within first 2 hours (LinkedIn algorithm boost)
- [ ] Share in relevant LinkedIn groups (AI, SaaS, Indie Hackers)

### Step 5: Ed Donner Engagement

- [ ] Tag Ed Donner in the post
- [ ] Send a direct message to Ed Donner with the post link + personal note
- [ ] If he engages, respond thoughtfully to continue conversation

## Key Messages to Emphasize

**From Ed Donner's Courses:**

- Theoretical foundation for AI agent architecture
- Product thinking for AI-powered products
- Confidence to tackle complex AI systems
- [TODO: Add 2-3 specific concepts once you list the courses]

**From Your Implementation:**

- Multi-persona orchestration (theory → practice)
- Production-ready MVP in 4 weeks
- 695 tests (quality matters)
- Real users, real deployment

**The Connection:**

- Courses gave you the mental models
- Claude Code gave you the implementation velocity
- You provided the product vision and architecture
- Result: Production SaaS that works

## Risk Mitigation

**Potential Concerns:**

1. **Appears promotional for Ed Donner**: Mitigate by making it genuinely about YOUR journey, not just course review
2. **Too salesy**: Focus on learning journey, not selling anything
3. **Article is LONG**: LinkedIn post should be SHORT (300-500 words), link to article for full story
4. **Ed Donner doesn't engage**: Still valuable for your audience; his engagement is bonus

**Quality Checks:**

- [ ] Does the post provide value even without Ed Donner's repost?
- [ ] Is the connection between courses and project authentic and specific?
- [ ] Does the post follow LinkedIn best practices (hook, story, CTA)?
- [ ] Have you avoided over-tagging or spammy hashtags?

1. Ed Donner engagement (like, comment, or repost)
2. 100+ reactions on LinkedIn post
3. 50+ clicks to Medium article
4. 10+ meaningful comments/conversations

**Secondary Goals:**

1. New LinkedIn connections from AI/SaaS community
2. Potential early adopter signups for Boailoop

### Immediate (Before Writing Post):

3. Find Ed Donner's LinkedIn profile

## Draft Structure Template (Approach A)

```
[HOOK - 2-3 sentences]
Last summer, I enrolled in @EdDonner's AI Agent Product Development courses on Udemy.
4 months later, I shipped a production SaaS with 468 commits, 695 tests, and real users.
Here's how theory became practice:

[JOURNEY - 3-4 paragraphs]
Ed's courses taught me [specific concept 1], [specific concept 2], and [specific concept 3].
The biggest lesson? [key insight from courses].

When I started building Boailoop (my AI advisory board platform), those concepts
weren't abstract anymore. Multi-persona orchestration, streaming responses, persistent
state management - it all clicked.

But here's what surprised me: knowing the theory made me confident to tackle the hard parts.
When I hit complex debugging sessions at 2 AM (serverless PDF processing, anyone?),
I had the mental models to solve them.

[RESULTS - metrics]
4 weeks. 468 commits. 695 automated tests. 25 API endpoints. Zero production incidents.
Deployed on Vercel. Real users getting simultaneous advice from 3-5 AI advisors.

[CTA - link + appreciation]
I wrote the full story - the wins, the late-night debugging, the honest lessons - on Medium.
Link in comments.

Thank you @EdDonner for making AI agent development approachable. Your courses gave me
the confidence to build something real.

For anyone considering these courses: they're heavy, they're comprehensive, and they work.
