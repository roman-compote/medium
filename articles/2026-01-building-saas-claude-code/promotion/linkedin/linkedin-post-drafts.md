# LinkedIn Post Drafts - Ed Donner Course Connection

## Draft A: "From Student to Builder" (Recommended)

**Character count: ~980** | **Recommended posting time: Tuesday-Thursday, 8-10 AM EST**

---

Last summer, I enrolled in @Ed Donner's AI Engineering courses on Udemy.

4 months later, I shipped a production SaaS with 468 commits, 695 tests, and real users.

Here's how theory became practice:

**The Journey:**

Ed's 4-track curriculum taught me everything from LLM engineering to production deployment to business strategy. But more importantly, it gave me the confidence to actually build something.

The courses covered:
• Multi-agent orchestration (Course 2) → Boailoop's 3-5 AI advisors collaborating
• RAG implementation (Course 1) → PDF upload with context injection
• Production deployment (Course 3) → Shipped on Vercel with Axiom monitoring
• Product thinking (Course 4) → Measured ROI, not just technical metrics

**The "Aha Moment":**

Ed's biggest lesson: "Favor workflow over autonomy initially. Start simple, then add."

When I started building Boailoop (my AI advisory board platform), I initially planned parallel LLM execution. Ed's framework helped me choose **sequential orchestration** instead - trading speed for cost predictability and reliability.

That decision made the difference between a prototype and production-ready code.

**The Late-Night Reality:**

Ed's courses didn't write the code for me. There were still:
• 3 PDF library attempts before finding serverless-compatible solution
• ~8 hours debugging at 2 AM
• 695 tests to ensure quality
• Real architectural decisions

But here's what surprised me: knowing the theory made me **confident to tackle the hard parts**. When I hit complex debugging sessions, I had the mental models to solve them.

**The Result:**

4 weeks. 468 commits. 695 automated tests. 25 API endpoints. Zero production incidents.

Deployed on Vercel. Real users getting simultaneous advice from 3-5 AI advisors.

I wrote the full story - the wins, the late-night debugging, the honest lessons - on Medium. [Link in comments]

**My Takeaway:**

Ed's courses taught me that AI agent development isn't scary if you understand the fundamentals. Multi-persona orchestration, streaming responses, persistent state management - it all clicked because I had the theory.

For anyone considering these courses: they're heavy, they're comprehensive, and they work. 400,000+ students across 190 countries can't be wrong.

Thank you @Ed Donner for making AI agent development approachable. Your courses gave me the confidence to build something real.

## Draft B: "The Course Review + Case Study"

**Character count: ~1100** | **Tone: More educational/review-focused**

---

I just finished Ed Donner's 4th AI Agent course on Udemy.

Here's what happened when I applied everything I learned:

**The Courses (Summer 2025 - January 2026):**

1️⃣ **LLM Engineering** (Course 1)
Foundation: RAG, prompting, vector embeddings, tools

2️⃣ **Agentic AI** (Course 2)
Frameworks: CrewAI, LangGraph, AutoGen, MCP

3️⃣ **MLOps** (Course 3)
Production: Vercel, AWS, monitoring, scaling

4️⃣ **Leadership** (Course 4)
Business: ROI, risk assessment, adoption strategies

**What Makes Them Different:**

Ed's courses aren't just theory. Each track includes **real-world projects** you can actually ship.

More importantly, Ed's tone throughout is: "Don't worry about AI complexity. Understand the fundamentals and just build."

That encouragement mattered.

**Applying the Learning:**

While taking the courses, I decided to test the concepts by building Boailoop - a multi-AI advisory board platform.

**Course concepts → Production implementation:**

• Multi-agent orchestration (Course 2) → 3-5 AI advisors debating each other
• RAG patterns (Course 1) → PDF upload with context injection
• SSE streaming (Course 1) → Real-time responses from multiple personas
• Production deployment (Course 3) → Vercel + Axiom monitoring + CI/CD
• Workflow design (Course 2) → Sequential (not parallel) for cost control
• Business metrics (Course 4) → Pilot deployment with measurable feedback

**The Honest Reality:**

Ed's courses gave me the **mental models**, not the code.

I still had to:
• Debug serverless PDF processing (3 library attempts)
• Write 695 tests for quality assurance
• Make architecture decisions (sequential vs parallel execution)
• Ship through late-night debugging sessions

But the courses made me **confident** to tackle these challenges.

**The Result:**

4 weeks of development:
✅ 468 commits
✅ 695 tests (96.8% pass rate)
✅ 25 REST API endpoints
✅ Production deployment on Vercel
✅ Real users providing feedback

Not a prototype. Production SaaS with comprehensive testing, monitoring, and infrastructure.

**Would I Recommend Ed's Courses?**

**Absolutely. Here's why:**

1. **Comprehensive** - Analytical, engineering, DevOps, AND business perspectives
2. **Practical** - 8+ real-world projects across all 4 tracks
3. **Current** - Updated Oct 2025 - Jan 2026 (not outdated tutorials)
4. **Encouraging** - Ed's tone: "You can do this. Just start."
5. **Proven** - 400,000+ students from 190 countries

The courses are "heavy" (Ed's description). They require weeks of focused work. But they deliver.

For anyone exploring AI agent development: these courses are worth the investment.

## Draft C: "Timeline Story" (Visual/Engaging)

**Character count: ~950** | **Tone: More narrative/storytelling**

---

**Summer 2025:** Enrolled in Ed Donner's AI Agent courses, intimidated but curious

**End of 2025:** Shipped a production SaaS with 468 commits, 695 tests, real users

**January 2026:** Finished all 4 courses, ready to share what I learned

Here's the story:

**📚 The Education (6 months):**

Ed Donner's 4-track curriculum covered everything:
→ LLM Engineering (RAG, prompting, vector embeddings)
→ Agentic AI (CrewAI, LangGraph, AutoGen, MCP)
→ MLOps (Production deployment, monitoring, scaling)
→ Leadership (Business strategy, ROI, risk assessment)

These courses are "heavy" (Ed's words). Comprehensive. Practical.

400,000+ students across 190 countries. There's a reason.

**💡 The Decision:**

Mid-way through the courses, Ed's lesson hit me:

> "Most people overthink AI. Start with the problem, not the solution. Just build."

So I did.

**🚀 The Build (4 weeks):**

I built Boailoop - a multi-AI advisory board platform where 3-5 specialized advisors (CTO, Marketing, CFO) debate business questions.

Every course concept showed up in the code:
• Multi-agent orchestration → 3-5 personas collaborating
• RAG implementation → PDF upload + context injection
• Streaming responses → SSE for real-time updates
• Production deployment → Vercel + Axiom monitoring
• Business thinking → Measured adoption, not just accuracy

**⚙️ The Reality:**

Ed's courses didn't write the code. I still had to:
• Debug serverless PDF processing (3 library attempts, 8 hours)
• Write 695 tests for production quality
• Choose sequential over parallel execution (cost vs speed trade-off)
• Ship through late-night sessions at 2 AM

But the courses gave me **confidence**. When I hit complex problems, I had the mental models to solve them.

**📊 The Result:**

4 weeks later:
✅ 468 commits
✅ 695 automated tests (96.8% pass rate)
✅ 25 REST API endpoints
✅ Production-ready SaaS deployed on Vercel
✅ Zero production incidents
✅ Real users providing feedback

**🎯 The Takeaway:**

Ed Donner's courses taught me that AI agent development isn't scary.

Multi-persona orchestration. Streaming responses. Persistent state. RAG. Production deployment.

It all clicked because I had the theory + Ed's encouragement to "just build."

I wrote the full story - wins, debugging sessions, honest lessons - on Medium. [Link in comments]

For anyone exploring AI development: Ed's courses are worth the time. Theory + practice + encouragement to ship.

Thank you @Ed Donner. Your courses gave me the foundation to build something real.
