## 💌 Ed Donner Outreach

### 8. Direct Message to Ed Donner

Send this AFTER posting (not before):

**Subject:** Thank you - Your courses helped me ship Boailoop

**Message:**

```
Hi Ed,

I wanted to personally thank you for your AI Agent courses on Udemy.

I started with your LLM Engineering course last summer, went through all 4 tracks, and just shipped my first production AI product - Boailoop (a multi-AI advisory board platform).

Your courses gave me the confidence to tackle multi-agent orchestration, production deployment, and real-world AI product development.

I wrote about the journey on LinkedIn and Medium, crediting your courses for the foundation:
[LINKEDIN_POST_URL]

The product is live on Vercel with real users. 468 commits, 695 tests, and zero production incidents.

Not asking for anything - just wanted to say thank you. Your encouragement to "just build" made the difference.

Best,
Roman
```

   - Slide 3: Course concepts → Boailoop features
   - Slide 4: The result (metrics)
   - Slide 5: "What I learned" (key takeaways)
   - Carousel posts get high engagement on LinkedIn

3. **Tag Additional Thought Leaders**
   - Only if genuinely relevant to the conversation
   - Don't over-tag (looks spammy)
   - Max 2-3 tags total (Ed Donner + 1-2 others if applicable)

---

## ⚠️ Important Reminders

1. **Don't tag Ed Donner excessively** - one clean tag in the post is enough
2. **Respond to ALL comments within 2 hours** - LinkedIn algorithm boost
3. **Link to Medium in FIRST COMMENT, not in post** - better algorithm performance
4. **Don't edit post after publishing** - algorithm penalizes edits
5. **Be authentic in responses** - don't copy-paste same reply to every comment
