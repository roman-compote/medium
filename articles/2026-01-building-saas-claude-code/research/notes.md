## Pattern Analysis (Preliminary)

### Common Themes:

1. **Speed narrative** - "Weekend," "24 hours," "Days not months"
2. **What worked vs. what didn't** - Balanced honesty performs well
3. **Specific tech stack** - Readers want concrete tools (Cursor, Supabase, Claude)
4. **Real numbers** - "300 lines," "18 MVPs," "7 months"
5. **Personal journey** - "I built," "Here's what happened"

### Title Patterns:

- First-person experience: "I Built..."
- Provocative questions: "Which One Wins?"
- Promise of learning: "Here's What Worked..."
- Accessibility: "And You Can Too"
- Time-bound achievements: "In a Weekend," "24 Hours"

### Content Structure (to analyze further):

- Problem/Context
- Solution/Approach
- Results/Learnings
- Actionable takeaways
