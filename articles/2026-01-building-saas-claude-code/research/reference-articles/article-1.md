As a founder, I spend a lot of time experimenting with tools that promise to make building faster, smarter, and easier. Some deliver, some disappoint, and some fall somewhere in between. I wanted to share a candid breakdown of the tools I’ve actually used while working on my startup from coding to UI/UX to backend.

## 1. Vibe Coding: Cursor, ChatGPT, and Claude

When you’re moving fast, your coding setup matters. I’ve been experimenting with **Cursor**, **ChatGPT**, and **Claude** to help with building features and debugging.

**Cursor**

- **Pros:** Seamless integration with VS Code, great at in-line coding assistance, feels like pair programming.
- **Cons:** Sometimes too verbose, and not always reliable on larger, more complex codebases.

**ChatGPT**

- **Pros:** Amazing for quick problem-solving, context-rich explanations, and generating starter code. It’s also versatile beyond coding (pitch decks, strategy notes, etc.).
- **Cons:** Struggles with maintaining context in long technical threads and can hallucinate libraries or methods.

**Claude**

- **Pros:** Great at handling long context windows (better memory across conversations), very strong at reasoning through architecture or complex workflows.
- **Cons:** Less polished coding output compared to Cursor or ChatGPT; sometimes over-explains instead of giving quick code snippets.

**Verdict:** Cursor is my go-to when I’m in the IDE, ChatGPT is best for fast answers and brainstorming, and Claude is my “deep thinker” when I need to reason through complex problems.

## 2. UI/UX: Playing Around with Uizard Pilot

I tested **Uizard Pilot** for UI/UX design to see how AI could shape early workflows. I haven’t fully implemented its designs yet, but here’s what I found:

**Pros:**

- Generates mockups quickly from text prompts or sketches.
- Good for idea validation and communicating concepts with non-Designers.
- Can save time in early brainstorming stages.

**Cons:**

- Designs can feel generic if you don’t customize heavily.
- Limited in capturing nuanced brand identity.
- Not yet strong enough to replace a designer for production-ready work.

**Verdict:** Great for fast prototyping, but I wouldn’t rely on it for final designs.

## 3. Frontend Development: Lovable

For frontend development, I’ve been using **Lovable** to speed up building. Interestingly, we didn’t just use it for scaffolding, we actually created most of the **user experience directly inside Lovable**.

**Pros:**

- Quick scaffolding gets you a working app skeleton in minutes.
- Smooth integration with backend tools like Supabase.
- Easy to test and iterate on user flows quickly.

**Cons:**

- Limited flexibility when it comes to heavy customization.
- Code sometimes needs cleanup or restructuring before scaling.
- Not ideal for pixel-perfect design.

**Comparison:**  
Compared to traditional React builds, Lovable is a rocket ship for MVPs. But for long-term scale, I’d still consider transitioning to a more flexible frontend framework.

## 4. Backend: Supabase

We paired Lovable with **Supabase** to handle backend needs. Supabase has been surprisingly robust for getting things off the ground fast.

**Pros:**

- Postgres-based, which makes it familiar and reliable.
- Authentication, APIs, and storage built in, no need to reinvent the wheel.
- Plays well with Lovable for fast prototyping.

**Cons:**

- Still maturing compared to Firebase or a custom backend.
- Scaling beyond early stage may require extra setup.

**Verdict:** Supabase + Lovable is a powerful combo for fast MVP building. It gave us a working product without needing a full backend team.

## 5. Still Figuring Out: SEO Optimization

One area we’re still actively working on is **SEO optimization**. Building the product has been priority #1, but we know discoverability matters. Right now, we’re testing out different SEO tools (from keyword planners to AI-driven optimization tools) to figure out what fits best for our product.

This is definitely an area we need to improve, and I’ll probably do a follow-up once we’ve locked in the right toolkit.

## Final Thoughts

No single tool does everything perfectly. What I’ve learned is:

- **Cursor + ChatGPT + Claude** together covers my coding needs speed, reasoning, and debugging.
- **Uizard Pilot** is useful for prototyping, but not for production-ready design.
- **Lovable + Supabase** has been an incredible combo for building and launching our user experience fast.
- **SEO** is our next frontier, and we’re still exploring the right stack there.

As a founder, the real trick is knowing when to lean on these tools and when to go back to basics. They’re accelerators, not replacements.
