## What We'll Analyze:

For each article, extract:

- [ ] Word count (estimate)
- [ ] Section structure (headings, flow)
- [ ] Opening hook (first 2-3 paragraphs)
- [ ] Tone (technical depth vs accessibility)
- [ ] Use of visuals (screenshots, code blocks, diagrams)
- [ ] Data/metrics included (numbers, timelines, results)
- [ ] Storytelling elements (challenges, learnings, surprises)
- [ ] Conclusion style (CTA, key takeaways, questions)
- [ ] Engagement indicators (claps estimate, comments if visible)

## Instructions:

**Option 1 (Recommended):** Paste the full article text in a file named:

- `research/article-1-simoni-shah.md`
- `research/article-2-deyan-aleksandrov.md`
- etc.

**Option 2:** Create a single file `research/pasted-articles.md` with all articles separated by `---`

I'll then analyze patterns and create our article outline based on what works.
